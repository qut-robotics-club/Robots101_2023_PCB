# ROBOTS101_2023


Goal:
To create a easy funtional Pi hat for the ROBOTS101 program.
This pi hat will:
- Label all pins & connections clearly.
- Breakout headers to reduce confusion and reduce dangerous connections
- Regualte Battery voltage & power the Pi Safely 
- Proved a direct and clear Power Switch
- (Optional) Expand GPIO for future Projects 
- Clean and streamline robot construction.

- Easy design for Future PCB Workshop
